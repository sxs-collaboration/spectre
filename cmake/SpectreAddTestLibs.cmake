# The functions in this file are used to set up test libraries.
# The way to use these functions is to first set the global properties:
#   set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY SPECTRE_TESTS_LIB_FUNCTIONS_PROPERTY "")
#   set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY SPECTRE_TESTS_LIBS_PROPERTY "")
#
# Then have various add_subdirectory commands, normally one per library.
# Each library must compile a list of source files, which is then passed to
# add_test_library. After all the test libraries have called add_test_library
# the function "write_test_registration_function" can be called
# to write the C++ header needed for registering the tests inside all the
# libraries. Finally, the test libraries that need to be linked into the test
# runner executable can be retrieved from the global property using:
#   get_property(SPECTRE_TESTS_LIBRARIES GLOBAL PROPERTY
#                SPECTRE_TESTS_LIBS_PROPERTY)
#
# and then adding ${SPECTRE_TESTS_LIBRARIES} as a lib to target_link_libraries.
#
# Note: Both add_test_library and write_test_registration_function
# are documented below.
