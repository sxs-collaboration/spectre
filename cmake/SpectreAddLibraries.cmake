  # CMake decides on the linking order is not clear when using
  # INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES and targets. To this end, we set a global
  # property SPECTRE_ALLOCATOR_LIBRARY that contains the link flag to link
  # to the memory allocator. By linking to the allocator library first
  # explicitly in target_link_libraries CMake correctly places the allocator
  # library as the first entry in the link libraries. We also link to the
  # SpectreAllocator target to pull in any additional allocator-related
  # flags, such as include directories.
