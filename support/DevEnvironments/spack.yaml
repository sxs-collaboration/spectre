# SpECTRE development environment that can be installed with the Spack package
# manager, both on clusters and personal machines.
#
# To install this environment, first clone
# [Spack](https://github.com/spack/spack) and refer to the
# [docs](https://spack.readthedocs.io/) for an introduction to Spack. Then:
#
#   $ spack env create YOUR_ENV_NAME support/DevEnvironments/spack.yaml
#   $ spack env activate YOUR_ENV_NAME -p
#
# Now you can adjust the environment for your system. You may want to `spack
# remove` and `spack add` some packages, e.g., to customize the Charm++
# installation or to omit packages provided by your system or installed via
# another package manager. To generate the list of packages that will be
# installed, run:
#
#   $ spack concretize -f [--reuse]
#
# You may want to run `spack external find` and concretize with `--reuse` to
# avoid reinstalling a bunch of system-provided packages. When you are happy
# with the concretized environment, run:
#
#   $ spack install
#
# All dependencies will be installed in the Spack build tree and linked into the
# environment. Now you can run CMake, build SpECTRE, etc. To pass options like
# `CHARM_ROOT` to CMake, if necessary, you can find the location of installed
# packages with `spack location --install-dir`.
#
# Since the `spack` command is quite slow, you can also generate a module file
# that is much faster to source:
#
#   $ spack env loads -r
#
# Now you can activate the environment by sourcing the generated module file.
#
# See the [Spack docs on environments](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html)
# for more information.
