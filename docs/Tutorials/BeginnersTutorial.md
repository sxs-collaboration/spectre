# A Hitchhiker's Guide to Running SpECTRE {#beginners_guide}

\tableofcontents

SpECTRE can be a bit complicated to get started with, especially if you aren't
familiar with our core concepts of task-based parallelism and Template
Meta-Programming (TMP). However, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don't_Panic">
Don't Panic</a>. This guide aims to get you introduced to running,
visualizing, editing, and then rebuilding SpECTRE to give you a feel for what
SpECTRE is all about, all on your own laptop! Hopefully by the end of this guide
you'll feel comfortable enough to look at other executables and maybe even
venture into the code itself!

## Prerequisites

To start off, you'll need to obtain an environment to build and run SpECTRE in.
You could try and install all the dependencies yourself, but that is very
tedious and very error prone. Instead, we provide a
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) container with all the
dependencies pre-installed for you to use. The container also has the SpECTRE
repository cloned in it already so you don't have to worry about getting it
yourself. To obtain the docker image, run

```
docker pull sxscollaboration/spectre:demo
```

Another program you will need for this tutorial is
[Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/download/) for visualizing the output. You
specifically will need version 5.10.1 for this tutorial.

If you'd like to use VSCode, the tutorial also has instructions for how to start
in VSCode as well.

## Into the Container

For both a terminal and VSCode, create the container in a terminal and start it.

```
docker create --entrypoint "/bin/bash" --rm --name spectre_demo -p 11111:11111 \
    -i -t sxscollaboration/spectre:demo
```
```
docker start spectre_demo
```

We connect port `11111` on your local machine to port `11111` of the container
so we can use Paraview. The `--rm` will delete the container when you stop it.
This won't put you into the container, only start it in the background.

\note The `--entrypoint "/bin/bash"` is important because the default entrypoint
of the container is the SpECTRE CLI. You can try out the default entrypoint by
running `docker run sxscollaboration/spectre:demo -h` and it'll print the help
string for the CLI. See the [Python documentation](py/cli.html) for more.

You can also run a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html) server for
accessing the Python bindings (see \ref spectre_using_python) or running Jupyter
notebooks. To do so, append another `-p` option with your specified port, e.g.
`-p 8000:8000`. You can chain as many `-p` options as you want to expose more
ports.

The SpECTRE repository is located at `/work/spectre` inside the container.


### With a Terminal {#with_terminal}

To hop in the container from a terminal, simply type

```
docker attach spectre_demo
```

and now you're in the container!

### With VSCode

If you're using VSCode, you'll need the `Remote-Containers` extension to be
able to access the container. Once you have it, open the
[command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette)
and run the following commands.

1. `Remote-Containers: Attach to Running Container` - you should see the
   container `spectre_demo` that's currently running. Select that.
2. `File: Open Folder` - select `/work/spectre` which is where the repo is.

Now you're in the container within VSCode! The terminal in VSCode will look
identical to the one if you hadn't used VSCode.

\note Any changes you make inside `/work/spectre` will be lost once you stop the
container. If you'd like your changes to persist, get rid of the `--rm` flag in
the `docker create` command.

## Compiling the code

\note From here on out, all paths are assumed to be inside the container unless
specified otherwise.

The container already has a SpECTRE build pre-configured. Go to the build
directory and compile the executables that we will use in this tutorial:

```sh
cd /work/spectre/build
make -j2 ExportCoordinates3D EvolveScalarAdvection2D all-pybindings
```

This will compile the code on two cores. If you'd like to use more cores, use
the `-j N` option where `N` is the number of cores.

Once the executables are compiled they will be available in the
`/work/spectre/build/bin` directory. The container already has this directory
added to the `PATH` environment variable, so you can run executables from the
command line right away:

```sh
spectre --help
```

If you are not in the container but instead on a desktop or cluster you can add
the bin directory to your path by `cd`ing to the build directory and running
```
export PATH=$PATH:`pwd`/bin
```
If you log out and log back in you will need to set this again, unless you add
it to your shell's init file.

## Running ExportCoordinates3D

First we will run the `ExportCoordinates3D` executable to visualize
the coordinates of a binary black hole domain.
Make a directory where you will run everything:

```
mkdir /work/runs
cd /work/runs
```

Copy over the input file
`/work/spectre/tests/InputFiles/ExportCoordinates/InputTimeDependent3D.yaml`
into your `/work/runs` directory. To run the executable, do

```
spectre run InputTimeDependent3D.yaml
```

This will run it on one core. If you'd like to use more cores, add the `-j N`
option where `N` is the number of cores. After this finishes you should
see two `H5` files in your run directory:

1. ExportCoordinates3DVolume0
2. ExportCoordinates3DReductions

The `Volume` file is where we store data from every element in our domain, like
the coordinates or the metric. The `Reductions` file is for more global
quantities like the minimum grid spacing over all the elements in our domain.

\note Next time you run the executable, you will have to either move or delete
the existing `H5` files as SpECTRE will error if it detects that an output file
already exists. This is to prevent you from accidentally overwriting data.
You can also use the `--force / -f` and `--clean-output / -C` flags to have
`spectre run` delete the existing files before running the executable.

## Visualizing our BBH Coordinates

Now it's time to use Paraview to visualize the coordinates we use for our BBH
evolutions! SpECTRE will actually export the physical frame coordinates for
every executable we have because they are a really useful diagnostic to have. We
are just using the ExportCoordinates executable here so that you don't have to
run a BBH evolution on your laptop which probably wouldn't work because of
memory requirements.

Before we get to Paraview, we have to tell paraview how to actually use the
coordinates in the `Volume` `H5` file. To do this we have a tool called
`generate-xdmf` in our Python command-line interface. Inside the `runs`
directory where you have the `H5` files, run

```
spectre generate-xdmf \
  --subfile-name element_data --output BBH_Coords \
  ExportCoordinates3DVolume*h5
```

We output volume data per node so we append the
node number to each volume file we have. Since you're most likely running on a
laptop, you'll only be running on one node so you should only get one output
file for the volume. The `--subfile-name` argument is the group name inside the
`H5` file where the data is stored (groups can be checked by
`h5ls -r FILE_NAME`). `generate-xdmf` will generate a file called
`BBH_Coords.xmf`. Make sure to keep this `.xmf` file next to the volume file it
was generated from. It uses relative paths to find the volume file which means
if you move it, you won't be able to visualize anything.

### Attaching Paraview

This is where we actually need Paraview. We have a headless (no GUI) vesion of
paraview inside the container which we will refer to as the "server". To start
the Paraview server, run

```
pvserver &
```

\note On compute clusters you should use the cluster-specific instructions for
using ParaView since you may require MPI and specifying which port to use. You can run `mpirun -np 1 pvserver -p PARAVIEW_REMOTE_PORT` on the remote cluster, where the `PARAVIEW_REMOTE_PORT` is the port that the paraView server will use on the cluster, you may choose it to be, for example, 11112. With 'pvserver' running on the remote machine, open a new local terminal and run `ssh -L11111:YOUR_CLUSTER:PARAVIEW_REMOTE_PORT USERNAME@YOUR_CLUSTER`.

The `&` is so that the server runs in the background. If you hit `Enter`
a couple times you'll get back to being able to type commands. You should see
some output similar to

```
Waiting for client...
Connection URL: cs://92bbb69f2af2:11111
Accepting connection(s): 92bbb69f2af2:11111
```

This means it's waiting for you to connect some external Paraview session (the
"client") to the server. Now, ***outside*** the container, start a session of
Paraview. 

\note To figure out the version of ParaView to use, run `mpirun -n 1 pvserver --version`, then download ***exactly the same*** version of Paraview. At the time when writing this tutorial, we are using ParaView 5.11.1  


Go to `File > Connect`. Click `Add Server`. Name it whatever you
want, but keep the Host as `localhost`, the Server Type as `Client/Server`, the
Port as `11111` (remember the `-p 11111:11111` flag from the docker command?).
Here's a snapshot of what it should look like before you configure.

\image html paraview_server.png "Paraview server settings"

Hit `Configure`, then hit `Save` (we don't care about the launch configuration).
Now you should see a list of your configured servers. Select the one you just
created and hit `Connect`. It may take a minute or two to connect to the server,
but once you do on the left you'll see something like

\image html paraview_connect.png "Successfully connected Paraview to a server"

\note If you close your client, the server will stop and you won't be able to
reconnect. You'll have to restart the server in the container.

### Open the XMF File in Paraview Client {#open_xmf}

Now that you have Paraview connected to the container, open the `BBH_Coords.xmf`
file you just generated inside Paraview (the paths you'll see are the ones in
the container, not your filesystem). You may be prompted to choose which XDMF
reader to use. Choose the `XDMF Reader` option. The `Xdmf3` options won't work.
Once you choose a reader, on the left, you'll see

\image html beginners_paraview_left.png "Paraview side-bar"

You can uncheck all the boxes in the `Point Arrays` section as they aren't
necessary for visualizing the coordinates. Then hit `Apply`. Now you should see
a solid sphere. This isn't super helpful. In the top bar you should see a
dropdown to change the style that the points are plotted in. Select `Surface
With Edges` like so. (Note: Your top bar may look slightly different from this
depending on what version of `Paraview` you have.)

\image html beginners_paraview_top.png "Paraview top-bar"

Now you'll have a solid sphere with highlighted lines. To view the interior of
the domain, you'll need to add a filter. To access the filters, navigate to
`Filters` on the top menu bar, hover over `Alphabetical`, and search for your
filter of choice.  Probably the two most helpful filters
for viewing the domain are the `Slice` and `Clip` filters. (Note that you'll
have to choose the `Surface With Edges` option for each filter separately.)

`Slice` is fairly self explanatory in that it will show you a single plane
through the domain. Experiment with different planes to see our whole domain
structure!

The `Clip` filter will remove all points "above" a certain plane, where "above"
is in the direction of the normal of that plane. If you combine two orthogonal
`Clip`s, you can actually view a 3D wedge of our domain. Try moving the centers
of the planes to view the domain around our excision surfaces! They have a lot
of cool structure.

If you'd like to read more about our BBH domain, you can look at the
documentation for `domain::creators::BinaryCompactObject`.

## Evolution of BBH Coordinates

Now that you are able to export and visualize our BBH domain coordinates at a
single time, let's make a small movie of the coordinates as they evolve! To do
this, we'll need to edit the input file `InputTimeDependent3D.yaml`. If you
aren't familiar with YAML, it's a file type that uses key-value pairs to create
actual objects in our C++ code. Feel free to experiment with keys and values in
our input files. If you're unsure about what a key or value should be, we offer
an easy way to check the options in the input file without running a whole
simulation. In your `/work/runs` directory, if you run

```
spectre validate InputTimeDependent3D.yaml
```

the executable will parse and check the input file. If you made a typo, or added
an incorrect key/value, a list of the available keys and their associated values
will be printed.

To change the number of times we output the coordinates, we'll need to go to the
`%EventsAndTriggers:` block of the input file. This block is mainly where we
specify which quantities we want to observe in a simulation or where we
"Trigger" a specific "Event" to happen. (For more info on `%EventsAndTriggers`,
see the \ref tutorial_events_and_triggers tutorial.) Currently in this input
file we only have one Trigger/Event pair. The %Trigger is `TimeCompares:` and
the %Event is `Completion`. To have the simulation run longer, change the
`Value:` under `TimeCompares:` to something larger. If you look at the
`Evolution:` block above the `%EventsAndTriggers:` block, you'll see that the
initial time step is `0.5`. The way this executable is set up, the coordinates
will be exported every time step. So set the final time `Value:` under
`TimeCompares:` to some larger multiple of `0.5` so that you'll have the
coordinates at a bunch of different times (a final time of `20` is reasonable.
Depending on how many cores you run on this should take a couple minutes).

Then, run the executable just like you did above (remember to move or delete the
existing `H5` files), run `generate-xdmf`, and open it in Paraview and apply
some filters of your choice. We recommend using a `Slice` filter with the normal
pointing in the `-z` direction. This is because our BBH domain rotates about the
`z` axis. Now, in the top bar of Paraview, you should see a "Play" button that
looks like a sideways triangle (see the second image in the \ref open_xmf
section). If you click this, Paraview will step through all the timesteps in the
output files and you'll be able to see the domain rotate a bit!

Next, we encourage you to play with the other inputs that control how the domain
evolves over time. These options are housed in the

```yaml
DomainCreator:
  BinaryCompactObject:
    ...
    TimeDependentMaps:
      ExpansionMap:
        ...
      RotationMap:
        ...
      SizeMapA:
        ...
      SizeMapB:
        ...
```

block of the input file. Since this tutorial is more about running the code, we
won't go into too much detail about each option. However, in general:

1. `ExpansionMap` is a global map (all parts of the domain) that controls the
   separation between the excision surfaces
2. `RotationMap` is a global map that controls how the excision spheres rotate
   about each other
3. `SizeMap` is a local map only around the excision spheres (not in the wave
   zone) that control the compression of grid points.

Play around with these values! You may get an error if you put something that's
too unphysical, but this is a fairly consequence-free playground for you to
explore so just try a different value.

Now you have a movie of how BBH coordinates evolve in a SpECTRE simulation!

## Exploring DG+FD

Now that you are able to run, and visualize SpECTRE, let's explore a feature
that is fairly unique to SpECTRE and is really powerful for handling
discontinuities and shocks in our simulations. We call this feature `DG+FD`
(it's also sometimes referred to as just `subcell`).

### Description of DG+FD

`FD` is the usual finite difference you are used to. All of the BSSN codes use
finite difference for solving Einstein's equations. FD is very good at capturing
shocks and discontinuities and is a very robust method, making it well suited
for hydro problems and other systems that have shocks and discontinuities.

`DG` stands for Discontinuous Galerkin. DG is a spectral method for representing
a solution on a grid, meaning that instead of taking the difference between the
function value at two points to get the derivative, it uses known basis
functions to represent the solution. Then the derivative can be known
analytically and you only need to supply the coefficients for the basis. DG
works best for representing smooth solutions; ones with very few shocks and
discontinuities (like GR in vacuum). This makes DG much faster than FD for
smooth solutions.

In SpECTRE, we combine these two different methods into one system to take
advantage of the strengths of each. When we have a solution that is smooth in
some parts of the domain, but has shocks in other parts, using only one of these
methods has disadvantages. If we only used DG, we wouldn't be able to resolve
the shocks very well driving the errors up a lot. If we only used FD, we'd be
able to represent the solution well, but it would be computationally
inefficient. So we combine DG+FD so that we only do DG in the parts of the
domain where the solution is smooth, and switch to FD in parts where there may
be a shock or discontinuity. The algorithm for switching between DG and FD is
explained in this image.

\image html dg_fd_schematic.png "Scheme for switching between DG and FD (credit: Nils Deppe)"

If you'd like to learn more about how SpECTRE implements its DG+FD scheme, you
can read [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11645) on the ArXiv.

### Running the Kuzmin Problem

To demonstrate DG+FD, we will be evolving the \link
ScalarAdvection::Solutions::Kuzmin Kuzmin \endlink problem using the
`EvolveScalarAdvection2D` executable. This is a simple test problem that
rotates a set of geometric shapes with uniform angular velocity, which can be
used to evaluate how well a numerical code can handle discontinuities stably
over time. Inside the container make a new directory `/work/runs2` where you
will run it. Also copy the default input file in
`/work/spectre/tests/InputFiles/ScalarAdvection/Kuzmin2D.yaml` to this new
`/work/runs2` directory.

### Changing the Default Input File

The default input file has very low resolution so we'll need to crank that up a
bit. The way to do this is to change the initial refinement levels and initial
number of grid points which are located in

```yaml
DomainCreator:
  Rectangle:
    ...
    InitialRefinement: [x, y]
    InitialGridPoints: [x, y]
```

`InitialRefinement:` represents how many times we split a `Block` in half in
order to create `Element`s, which are the fundamental units of our domain. So an
initial refinement of `[1, 1]` means we split a single Block into 4 elements
(split in half once in each direction). For an initial refinement of `[2, 2]` we
first do 1 refinement like before, and then split each of the resulting 4
elements in half again in each direction, resulting in 16 total Elements. To
determine the total number of Elements for a given refinement (same in all
directions), just do $2^{\mathrm{Dim * Refinement}}$. If you're confused by
the terminology we use to describe the domain, we have a \ref domain_concepts
guide that explains all terms related to our domain.

`InitialGridPoints` represents the number of grid points per dimension in each
Element after the final refinement has been applied. So if we had an initial
refinement of `[2, 2]` like above and then initial grid points `[3, 3]` in each
Element, we'd have a total of 9x16=144 grid points.

As for actual numbers to use, you can experiment to see what gives good,
well-resolved results. You'll definitely need more refinement than the default
input file, but since refinement scales exponentially, this can become very
expensive very quickly. On a laptop, you probably shouldn't go higher than
refinement `[6, 6]`. As for grid points, this will depend on how much refinement
you have. If you have a ton of small elements, you won't need too many grid
points to resolve the solution; something like `[4, 4]` would work. If you don't
have a lot of refinement, you may want more grid points if you still want to
resolve your solution. For a DG scheme, increasing the number of grid points (p
refinement) reduces the numerical error exponentially where the solution is
smooth, so computational resources are used more effectively. However, to
resolve shocks and discontinuities we have to refine the domain into more and
smaller elements instead (h refinement). Striking the most effective balance
between h and p refinement in different parts of the domain is the job of an
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) algorithm.

The default input file only runs for a few time steps so we'll want to make this
run longer so we can actually see some evolution. From the documentation of the
\link ScalarAdvection::Solutions::Kuzmin Kuzmin \endlink system, the solution
will rotate with an angular velocity of `1.0` (in code units). Thus, to do a
full orbit, it will take `6.28` code units of time. In the `%EventsAndTriggers:`
block of the input file, we see that the `Completion` event is triggered by the
`Slabs` trigger. We could, in theory, calculate out how many slabs `6.28` code
units is using the time step, but that's super tedious. Instead let's trigger
completion using the `TimeCompares` trigger instead. We used this before when
exporting the BBH coordinates, so just copy over the yaml block and change the
`Value:`.

Your final `%EventsAndTriggers:` block should look something like this:

```yaml
EventsAndTriggers:
  - Trigger:
      TimeCompares:
        Comparison: GreaterThanOrEqualTo
        Value: 6.28
    Events:
      - Completion
  ...
```

Now you should be ready to run the executable and get some output. Here, you
will almost definitely benefit by running this on many cores by adding the
`-j N` flag to the command you use to run the executable. Since we use lots
of smaller elements, we distribute these over the available resources via a
\link domain::BlockZCurveProcDistribution space filling curve \endlink to speed
things up.

```
spectre run Kuzmin2D.yaml -j4
```

### Visualizing the Kuzmin Problem

Once your run finishes, extract the volume data with `generate-xdmf` using

```
spectre generate-xdmf \
  --subfile-name VolumeData --output kuzmin_problem \
  ScalarAdvectionKuzmin2DVolume*h5
```

(Note that the `subfile-name` is different than before because it was different
in the input file) and load it into Paraview once again. We are only interested
in the quantity `U` which is the scalar field we were evolving. You can uncheck
any other boxes. So now, instead of coordinates on your screen, you should see a
large square colored by the solution profile described in the \link
ScalarAdvection::Solutions::Kuzmin Kuzmin \endlink system. You should also
notice that there are smaller squares that don't touch each other in the middle
of the domain and on the edges there are large sections that are continuous.
These are the FD and DG grids, respectively. If you go to the top bar in
Paraview and change how you view the grid to `Surface With Edges`, this will
become even more apparent.

You will notice that the FD grid is mostly around where the interesting features
are in the solution profile; the cylinder with a wedge cut out, the cone, and
the hump. And then the DG grid is mostly where the solution should be zero
towards the boundary of the domain (i.e. the very smooth part). So right from
the start, you can see that we are saving computational effort by only doing the
expensive, yet robust, method (FD) where it is necessary and the efficient
method (DG) everywhere else where the solution is smooth.

Now hit the "Play" button in the top bar of Paraview and watch the solution
evolve. You'll notice that the elements in the domain switch back and forth
between FD and DG. They do so in such a way that the elements will switch to FD
when an interesting feature enters the element and then switch back to DG once
the feature leaves. In this way, we are able to actually track shocks and
discontinuities in real time in our solution by where the code switches to using
FD instead of DG. This is extremely useful for expensive GRMHD simulations where
we only want to do FD at a shock boundary, yet that shock boundary is moving
through the domain. We are able to dynamically track this shock and resolve it
well with FD, then switch back to DG after the shock passes through and the
solution has settled down again.

A pretty cool filter you can add is `Warp By Scalar`. In the left panel, choose
the solution variable `U` as the scalar to use and hit `Apply`. In the viewing
panel there should be a `2D` or `3D` button that you can toggle to make the view
3D. Once you do that you should be able to see that the height of the feature is
your solution `U`. If you change the grid to `Surface With Edges` you can see
the FD or DG grids warp with the solution. And if you hit "Play" it'll rotate
around and you'll see the features moving in 3D! (Don't worry if you can't find
this filter. Not all versions of Paraview may have it.)

We encourage you to play around with the refinement and grid points before the
next section to get a feel for how each changes the runtime and accuracy of
solution.

## Editing the Kuzmin System

Hopefully now you feel comfortable enough running SpECTRE that you
can get the default input file for the pre-built executables, edit it, and run
it. Now we are going to try our hand at actually editing some code in SpECTRE
and then building SpECTRE. We're going to stick with the \link
ScalarAdvection::Solutions::Kuzmin Kuzmin \endlink system and add a new feature
to the solution profile!

You can find the files for the Kuzmin system at
`/work/spectre/src/PointwiseFunctions/AnalyticSolutions/ScalarAdvection/
Kuzmin.?pp`.
In the `hpp` file, you'll see a lot of Doxygen documentation and then the actual
Kuzmin class. The only function that you will need to care about is

```cpp
template <typename DataType>
tuples::TaggedTuple<ScalarAdvection::Tags::U> variables(
    const tnsr::I<DataType, 2>& x, double t,
    tmpl::list<ScalarAdvection::Tags::U> /*meta*/) const;
```

All of our analytic solutions have a function similar to this that will set the
value corresponding to the tag in the return type. If you're unfamiliar with
tags in SpECTRE, you can look at these sections for an explanation, \ref
databox_a_taggedtuple_databox and \ref databox_a_proper_databox. However, it's
basically just a fancy way of doing a compile-time key/value pair. The tag is
the key, and the value is whatever you want it to be. In our case, the value is
a tensor, representing the solution.

The definition of this function in the `cpp` file is where you will be editing
the actual Kuzmin solution. Towards the bottom of this function, there is a
`for` loop that sets the solution at every grid point. This is where you will
add in a new feature to the solution.

You can pick any feature you want to add, so long as it's inside the domain
bounds of `[0,1]x[0,1]` and centered around `(0.75, 0.5)`. This is because of
how the kuzmin solution is set up with existing features at `(0.25, 0.5); (0.5,
0.25); (0.5, 0.75)`. If you're having trouble thinking of a feature to add try
one of the following features:

- Square centered at `(0.75, 0.5)` with solution value `1.0`
  - Side length `0.1` (any larger and it might interfere with the other
    features)
  - Circle of radius `0.045` centered on the square with value `0.0`
- Triangle centered at `(0.75, 0.5)` with one corner facing in the `+x`
  direction with solution value `1.0`
- Square centered at `(0.75, 0.5)`
  - Side length `0.1` (any larger and it might interfere with the other
    features)
  - Left half of the square has value `1.0` and right half of the square has
    value `0.5`

\note The more detailed you make your feature, the more resolution you will need
to resolve it.

### Re-building SpECTRE

Once you have your feature coded up, go ahead and save your changes. Now we will
build SpECTRE! Go to the `/work/spectre/build` directory. This is where you have
to be in order to build SpECTRE. We use [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to configure
our build directory. However, since the executables are already pre-built, this
means the build directory is already configured! So you don't have to worry
about `CMake` for now. If you wanted to reconfigure, for example using a
different compiler, then you'd have to run `CMake`. If you want to learn more
about how we use `CMake`, take a look at the \ref common_cmake_flags developers
guide.

To build the Kuzmin executable, run

```
make EvolveScalarAdvection2D
```

This should be very fast because you only edited a `cpp` file. Congrats! You've
just built SpECTRE!

Now re-run the executable in your `/work/runs2` directory. Hopefully everything
works and you get some output. When you plot it in Paraview, it should look
almost the same as before except your feature will be there too rotating with
the others! How cool! You can also see if your feature needs FD or DG more by
how much it switches back and forth.

Experiment some more with either different features or different resolution!

## Conclusions

Congrats! You've made it through the tutorial! If you only want to run our
pre-built executables, you have all the tools necessary to run, visualize, and
re-build them. If you want a full list of our executables, do
`make list` in the build directory. This will also include our `Test_`
executables which you can just ignore.

In an already configured build directory, all you have to do to build a new
executable is

```
make ExecutableName
```

and then you can copy the default input file from
`/work/spectre/tests/InputFiles` and run it. Running an executable with the
`--help` flag will give a description of what system is being evolved and the
input options necessary.
