 * \brief Distribution strategy for assigning elements to CPUs using a
 * Morton ('Z-order') space-filling curve to determine placement within each
 * block, where `Element`s are distributed across CPUs
 *
 * \details The element distribution attempts to assign a balanced total
 * computational cost to each processor that is allowed to have `Element`s.
 * First, each `Block`'s `Element`s are ordered by their Z-curve index (see more
 * below). `Element`s are traversed in this order and assigned to CPUs in order,
 * moving onto the next CPU once the target cost per CPU is met. The target cost
 * per CPU is defined as the remaining cost to distribute divided by the
 * remaining number of CPUs to distribute to. This is an important distinction
 * from simply having one constant target cost per CPU defined as the total cost
 * divided by the total number of CPUs with elements. Since the total cost of
 * `Element`s on a processor will nearly never add up to be exactly the average
 * cost per CPU, this means that we would either have to decide to overshoot or
 * undershoot the average as we iterate over the CPUs and assign `Element`s. If
 * we overshoot the average on each processor, the final processor could have a
 * much lower cost than the rest of the processors and we run the risk of
 * overshooting so much that one or more of the requested processors don't get
 * assigned any `Element`s at all. If we undershoot the average on each
 * processor, the final processor could have a much higher cost than the others
 * due to remainder cost piling up. This algorithm avoids these risks by instead
 * adjusting the target cost per CPU as we finish assigning cost to previous
 * CPUs.
 *
 * Morton curves are a simple and easily-computed space-filling curve that
 * (unlike Hilbert curves) permit diagonal traversal. See, for instance,
 * \cite Borrell2018 for a discussion of mesh partitioning using space-filling
 * curves.
 * A concrete example of the use of a Morton curve in 2d is given below.
 *
 * A sketch of a 2D block with 4x2 elements, with each element labeled according
 * to the order on the Morton curve:
 * ```
 *          x-->
 *          0   1   2   3
 *        ----------------
 *  y  0 |  0   2   4   6
 *  |    |  | / | / | / |
 *  v  1 |  1   3   5   7
 * ```
 * (forming a zig-zag path, that under some rotation/reflection has a 'Z'
 * shape).
 *
 * The Morton curve method is a quick way of getting acceptable spatial locality
 * -- usually, for approximately even distributions, it will ensure that
 * elements are assigned in large volume chunks, and the structure of the Morton
 * curve ensures that for a given processor and block, the elements will be
 * assigned in no more than two orthogonally connected clusters. In principle, a
 * Hilbert curve could potentially improve upon the gains obtained by this class
 * by guaranteeing that all elements within each block form a single
 * orthogonally connected cluster.
 *
 * The assignment of portions of blocks to processors may use partial blocks,
 * and/or multiple blocks to ensure an even distribution of elements to
 * processors.
 * We currently make no distinction between dividing elements between processors
 * within a node and dividing elements between processors across nodes. The
 * current technique aims to have a simple method of reducing communication
 * globally, though it would likely be more efficient to prioritize minimization
 * of inter-node communication, because communication across interconnects is
 * the primary cost of communication in charm++ runs.
 *
 * \warning The use of the Morton curve to generate a well-clustered element
 * distribution currently assumes that the refinement is uniform over each
 * block, with no internal structure that would be generated by, for instance
 * AMR.
 * This distribution method will need alteration to perform well for blocks with
 * internal structure from h-refinement. Morton curves can be defined
 * recursively, so a generalization of the present method is possible for blocks
 * with internal refinement
 *
 * \tparam Dim the number of spatial dimensions of the `Block`s
