/// Holds element logical coordinates of an arbitrary set of points on
/// a single `Element`.  The arbitrary set of points is assumed to be
/// a subset of a larger set of points spanning multiple `Element`s,
/// and this class holds `offsets` that index into that larger set of
/// points.
///
/// \details `offsets.size()` is the same as the size of the `DataVector`
/// inside `element_logical_coords`.
///
/// This is used during the process of interpolating volume quantities
/// on the `Elements` (e.g. the spatial metric) onto an arbitrary set
/// of points (e.g. the points on an apparent horizon or a
/// wave-extraction surface) expressed in some frame.  Here is an
/// outline of how this interpolation proceeds, and where
/// `element_logical_coordinates` and `block_logical_coordinates` fit
/// into the picture:
///
/// Assume some component (e.g. HorizonA) has a `Tensor<DataVector>`
/// of target coordinate points in some coordinate frame.  The goal is
/// to determine the `Element` and logical coordinates of each point,
/// have each `Element` interpolate volume data onto the points
/// contained inside that `Element`, and send the interpolated data
/// back to the component.  The first step of this process is to
/// determine the block_id and block_logical_coordinates of each
/// point; this is done by the component (e.g. HorizonA), which calls
/// the function `block_logical_coordinates` on its full set of target
/// points.  The result of `block_logical_coordinates` is then
/// communicated to the members of a NodeGroup component
/// (e.g. HorizonManager).  Each node of the NodeGroup then calls
/// `element_logical_coordinates`, which returns a map of `ElementId`
/// to `ElementLogicalCoordHolder` for all the `Element`s on that node
/// that contain one or more of the target points. The NodeGroup
/// (which already has received the volume data from the `Elements` on
/// that node), interpolates the volume data to the element logical
/// coordinates for all of these `ElementId`s.  The `offsets` in the
/// `ElementLogicalCoordHolder` are the indices into the `DataVectors`
/// of the original target coordinates and will be used to assemble
/// the interpolated data into `Tensor<DataVector>`s that have the
/// same ordering as the original target coordinates. The NodeGroups
/// perform a reduction to get the data back to the original
/// component.
