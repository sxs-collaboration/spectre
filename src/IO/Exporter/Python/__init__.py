    Interpolates volume data to points by calling 'interpolate_to_points'.
    However, instead of passing a list of tensor components
    (like 'SpatialMetric_xx') you can pass a list of tensor names (like
    'SpatialMetric') and their corresponding types (like
    'tnsr.ii[DataVector, 3]') and this function will assemble the tensors
    and return them as a list.

    Note: It would be nice to move this function into C++, but that's not
    trivial because the tensor types are not known at compile time. This can be
    revisited when we have Python support for Variables.
