 * \ingroup HDF5Group
 * \brief A volume data subfile written inside an H5 file.
 *
 * The volume data inside the subfile can be of any dimensionality greater than
 * zero. This means that in a 3D simulation, data on 2-dimensional surfaces are
 * written as a VolumeData subfile. Data can be written using the
 * `write_volume_data()` method. An integral observation id is used to keep
 * track of the observation instance at which the data is written, and
 * associated with it is a floating point observation value, such as the
 * simulation time at which the data was written. The observation id will
 * generally be the result of hashing the temporal identifier used for the
 * simulation.
 *
 * \par Grid names
 * The data stored in the subfile are the tensor components passed to the
 * `write_volume_data()` method as a `std::vector<ElementVolumeData>`. Typically
 * the `GRID_NAME` should be the output of the stream operator of the spatial ID
 * of the parallel component element sending the data to be observed. For
 * example, in the case of a dG evolution where the spatial IDs are
 * `ElementId`s, the grid names would be of the form `[B0,(L2I3,L2I3,L2I3)]`.
 *
 * \par Data layout in the H5 file
 * The data are written contiguously inside of the H5 subfile, in that each
 * tensor component has a single dataset which holds all of the data from all
 * elements, e.g. a tensor component `T_xx` which is found on all grids appears
 * in the path `H5_FILE_NAME/SUBFILE_NAME.vol/OBSERVATION_ID/GRID_NAME/T_xx` and
 * that is where all of the `T_xx` data from all of the grids resides. Note that
 * coordinates must be written as tensors in order to visualize the data in
 * ParaView, Visit, etc.  In order to reconstruct which data came from which
 * grid, the `get_grid_names()`, and `get_extents()` methods list the grids
 * and their extents in the order which they and the data were written.
 * For example, if the first grid has name `GRID_NAME` with extents
 * `{2, 2, 2}`, it was responsible for contributing the first 2*2*2 = 8 grid
 * points worth of data in each tensor dataset. Use the
 * `h5::offset_and_length_for_grid` function to compute the offset into the
 * contiguous dataset that corresponds to a particular grid.
 *
 * \par Domain and FunctionsOfTime
 * A serialized representation of the domain and the functions of time can be
 * written into the subfile alongside the tensor data. Reconstructing the domain
 * (specifically the block maps) is needed for accurate interpolation of the
 * tensor data to another set of points. The domain is currently stored as a
 * `std::vector<char>`, and it is up to the calling code to serialize and
 * deserialize the data, taking into account that files may be written and read
 * with different versions of the code.
 *
 * \warning Currently the topology of the grids is assumed to be tensor products
 * of lines, i.e. lines, quadrilaterals, and hexahedrons. However, this can be
 * extended in the future. If support for more topologies is required, please
 * file an issue.
