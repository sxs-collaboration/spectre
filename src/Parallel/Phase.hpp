 * \ingroup ParallelGroup
 * \brief The possible phases of an executable
 *
 * \details Spectre executables are split into distinct phases separated by
 * global synchronizations.  Each executable will start with phase
 * `Initialization` and end with phase `Exit`.  The metavariables of each
 * executable must define `default_phase_order`, an array of Parallel::Phase
 * that must contain at least `Initialization` as the first element and `Exit`
 * as the last element.  Usually the next phase is determined from the
 * `default_phase_order` provided by the metavariables.  If more complex
 * decision making is desired, use the PhaseControl infrastructure.
 *
 * \warning The phases are in alphabetical order.  Do not use the values of the
 * underlying integral type as they will change as new phases are added to the
 * list!
 *
 * \see PhaseChange and \ref dev_guide_parallelization_foundations
 * "Parallelization infrastructure" for details.
