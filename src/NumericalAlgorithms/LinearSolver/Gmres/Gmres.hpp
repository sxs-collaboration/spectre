 * \ingroup LinearSolverGroup
 * \brief A GMRES solver for nonsymmetric linear systems of equations
 * \f$Ax=b\f$.
 *
 * \details The only operation we need to supply to the algorithm is the
 * result of the operation \f$A(p)\f$ (see \ref LinearSolverGroup). Each
 * invocation of the `perform_step` action expects that \f$A(q)\f$ has been
 * computed in a preceding action and stored in the DataBox as
 * %db::add_tag_prefix<LinearSolver::Tags::OperatorAppliedTo,
 * db::add_tag_prefix<LinearSolver::Tags::Operand, typename
 * Metavariables::system::fields_tag>>.
 *
 * Note that the operand \f$q\f$ for which \f$A(q)\f$ needs to be computed is
 * not the field \f$x\f$ we are solving for but
 * `db::add_tag_prefix<LinearSolver::Tags::Operand, typename
 * Metavariables::system::fields_tag>`. This field is initially set to the
 * residual \f$q_0 = b - A(x_0)\f$ where \f$x_0\f$ is the initial value of the
 * `Metavariables::system::fields_tag`.
 *
 * When the `perform_step` action is invoked after the operator action
 * \f$A(q)\f$ has been computed and stored in the DataBox, the GMRES algorithm
 * implemented here will converge the field \f$x\f$ towards the solution and
 * update the operand \f$q\f$ in the process. This requires reductions over
 * all elements that are received by a `ResidualMonitor` singleton parallel
 * component, processed, and then broadcast back to all elements. Since the
 * reductions are performed to find a vector that is orthogonal to those used in
 * previous steps, the number of reductions increases linearly with iterations.
 * No restarting mechanism is currently implemented. The actions are implemented
 * in the `gmres_detail` namespace and constitute the full algorithm in the
 * following order:
 * 1. `PerformStep` (on elements): Start an Arnoldi orthogonalization by
 * computing the inner product between \f$A(q)\f$ and the first of the
 * previously determined set of orthogonal vectors.
 * 2. `StoreOrthogonalization` (on `ResidualMonitor`): Keep track of the
 * computed inner product in a Hessenberg matrix, then broadcast.
 * 3. `OrthogonalizeOperand` (on elements): Proceed with the Arnoldi
 * orthogonalization by computing inner products and reducing to
 * `StoreOrthogonalization` on the `ResidualMonitor` until the new orthogonal
 * vector is constructed. Then compute its magnitude and reduce.
 * 4. `StoreFinalOrthogonalization` (on `ResidualMonitor`): Perform a QR
 * decomposition of the Hessenberg matrix to produce a residual vector.
 * Broadcast to `NormalizeOperandAndUpdateField` along with a termination
 * flag if the `LinearSolver::OptionTags::ConvergenceCriteria` are met.
 * 5. `NormalizeOperandAndUpdateField` (on elements): Set the operand \f$q\f$ as
 * the new orthogonal vector and normalize. Use the residual vector and the set
 * of orthogonal vectors to determine the solution \f$x\f$.
 *
 * \see ConjugateGradient for a linear solver that is more efficient when the
 * linear operator \f$A\f$ is symmetric.
