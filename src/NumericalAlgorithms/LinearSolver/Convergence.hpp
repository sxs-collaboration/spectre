/*!
 * \ingroup LinearSolverGroup
 * \brief Criteria that determine the linear solve has converged
 *
 * \details Most criteria are based on the residual magnitude
 * \f$|r_k|=|b-Ax_k|\f$, where \f$x_k\f$ denotes the numerical solution after
 * completion of iteration \f$k\f$ (see the \ref LinearSolverGroup
 * documentation, `LinearSolver::Tags::Residual` and
 * `LinearSolver::Tags::Magnitude`).
 *
 * The following criteria are implemented, ordered from highest to lowest
 * priority:
 *
 * - AbsoluteResidual: Matches if the residual has reached this magnitude.
 * - RelativeResidual: Matches if the residual has decreased by this factor,
 * relative to the start of the first linear solver iteration.
 * - MaxIterations: Matches if the number of iterations exceeds this limit.
 *
 * \note The smallest possible residual magnitude the linear solver can reach is
 * the product between the machine epsilon and the condition number of the
 * linear operator that is being inverted. Smaller residuals are numerical
 * artifacts. Requiring an absolute or relative residual below this limit will
 * likely lead to termination by `MaxIterations`.
 *
 * \note Remember that when the linear operator \f$A\f$ corresponds to a PDE
 * discretization, decreasing the linear solver residual below the
 * discretization error will not improve the numerical solution any further.
 * I.e. the error \f$e_k=x_k-x_\mathrm{analytic}\f$ to an analytic solution
 * will be dominated by the linear solver residual at first, but even if the
 * discretization \f$Ax_k=b\f$ was exactly solved after some iteration \f$k\f$,
 * the discretization residual
 * \f$Ae_k=b-Ax_\mathrm{analytic}=r_\mathrm{discretization}\f$ would still
 * remain. Therefore, ideally choose the absolute or relative residual criteria
 * based on an estimate of the discretization residual.
