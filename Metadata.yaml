Description: |
  SpECTRE is an open-source code for multi-scale, multi-physics problems
  in astrophysics and gravitational physics. In the future, we hope that
  it can be applied to problems across discipline boundaries in fluid
  dynamics, geoscience, plasma physics, nuclear physics, and
  engineering. It runs at petascale and is designed for future exascale
  computers.

  SpECTRE is being developed in support of our collaborative Simulating
  eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) research program into the multi-messenger
  astrophysics of neutron star mergers, core-collapse supernovae, and
  gamma-ray bursts.

Authors:
  Description: |
    We maintain three tiers of authors for the code as a whole: Core, Developers
    and Contributors. The full author list for the SpECTRE DOI is built by
    concatenating all authors in the order they are listed here.

    The primary goal of this author list is to recognize infrastructure work
    that does not or cannot have any science papers and results associated with
    it. Through authorship on the SpECTRE DOI such work gains recognition that
    holds value in academia. Authorship on the SpECTRE DOI does not directly
    entitle a person for authorship rights on other publications. Authorship
    rights on publications related to SpECTRE are governed by our publication
    policy.

    Note that the placement of authors in these tiers is inherently a subjective
    topic since we are forced to compare different projects people work on.
    Nevertheless, having guidelines and some way of promoting healthy and
    constructive discussions is vital for ensuring the collaborative aspect of
    the code is healthy.

  Core:
    Description: |
      For the time a Developer serves as Core developer they take on some
      project-management responsibilities, such as initiating and signing off on
      code reviews, maintaining compatibility with third-party libraries,
      maintaining the CI/CD infrastructure and overseeing the code as a whole.

      Guidelines on becoming a Core developer:

      - Have at least 4-5 major infrastructure contributions, each taking
        roughly 4-5 weeks of full-time work for an existing Core developer.
      - Seek out PRs to review and volunteer when calls for a reviewer are
        made.
      - Reach out to any of the existing Core developers and express your
        interest in taking on the responsibilities that come with this role. The
        Core developers will discuss the request and either appoint you to Core
        developer or provide you with feedback on what they think remains to be
        done.

      Note that most people will not end up in the Core developer list since a
      lot of work will lead to science results and authorship on science papers,
      which pay dividends for the work. Supervising students and postdocs does
      not count towards Core developer status.

      Guidelines on stepping down as Core developer:

      - After a Core developer leaves the project they will remain in this tier
        for at least as long as they were already in the Core tier before they
        left, or for three years, whichever is longer. At that point the Core
        developers will discuss if the person should be moved to the Developer
        tier, where they will stay indefinitely.
      - A Core developer can step down from the Core developer role at any time.

      The author list order is decided by the Core developers.

  Developers:
    Description: |
      Developers have contributed major features to SpECTRE and remain in this
      list indefinitely unless they wish to be removed.

      Guidelines on becoming a Developer:

      - Do some code review, does not need to be self-initiated.
      - Somewhere around 40 commits and 10k-15k lines of code should trigger a
        discussion among the Core developers to move someone from Contributors
        to Developers. These are guidelines and being above or below these
        arbitrary cutoffs does not automatically include or exclude you. E.g.
        someone doing complicated low-level code will likely become a Developer
        with far fewer lines of code contributed.
      - Anyone supervising a Core developer or two Developers may be considered
        for Developer status. Whether to be placed as Developer or Contributor
        will depend on how active the supervision is. If most of the supervision
        is coming from the Core developers then Contributor status is
        appropriate. This will be discussed with the person supervising the Core
        developer and/or Developers.

  Contributors:
    Description: |
      Anyone who has contributed to SpECTRE will be added to this list and
      remain a Contributor indefinitely unless they wish to be removed.

      Guidelines on becoming a Contributor:

      - See our guidelines in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` for information on how to
        get involved with SpECTRE development.
      - Having any PR merged qualifies for this list. If multiple people worked
        on the PR together, e.g. several undergraduate students contributing to
        a single PR, all persons involved will become a Contributor.
      - Supervising a project that results in a merged PR qualifies for this
        list. The supervision must be active, i.e. not primarily done by the
        Core developers.
      - Having an idea for a contribution does not count towards any contributor
        status. There must be active supervision of the person(s) implementing
        the idea, such as advice on debugging, how to best implement the idea,
        etc. The supervision is what will be counted for contributor status.
        Generally, a paper is written where the person who came up with the idea
        is a co-author, which is how credit is given for the idea. An example is
        suggesting "We should try reconstruction scheme X" without continued
        guidance throughout the implementation process would not be counted for
        contributor status.
